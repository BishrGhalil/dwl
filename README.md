# dwl - dwm for Wayland

This is my patched version of dwl.

dwl is a compact, hackable compositor for [Wayland] based on [wlroots]. It is
intended to fill the same space in the Wayland world that dwm does in X11,
primarily in terms of philosophy, and secondarily in terms of functionality.

### Patches
